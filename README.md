# Fish the Fishes

**Fish the Fishes** is a mobile video game developed as a challenge in a week, that then served as a tech demo to learn how to use the Godot game engine.

It currently features a small compendium, multiple biomes to visit, a few pieces of equipment, various game modes and multiple achievements.
